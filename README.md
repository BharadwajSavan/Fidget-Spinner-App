# Fidget Spinner App (using MIT AI2)

This app gives you a visual experience of spinning a fidgy (fidget spinner). 

With the help of sliders you can control the speed and friction of spinning.

You can also change the color of the spinner by tapping on the three bars, beside the label 'Let's spin!'

The below image is the interface of the application:
